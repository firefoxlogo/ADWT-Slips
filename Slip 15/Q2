Q:30: Model the following movie system as a Graph database.
Consider a information about of movie and actors. One movie can have
more than one actor
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and
draw a high-level Graph model. [3]
2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
visualize your actual Graph model. [3]
3. Answer the Queries:
a. Find movie which made highest business. [3]
b. Display details of movie along with actors. [3]
c. List all the movie of “Shahrukh Khan”. [4]
d. Display all movie having more than 2 awards received
[4]
Solution
Graph Model:
1.	Labels and Relationships:
○	Labels:
■	Movie
■	Actor
○	Relationships:
■	(Movie)-[:ACTED_IN]->(Actor) (relationship between Movie and Actor)
■	(Movie)-[:HAS_AWARDS]->(Award) (relationship to represent awards received by a movie)
2.	High-Level Graph Model:
   	(Movie)-[:ACTED_IN]->(Actor)
   	/
(Movie)-[:HAS_AWARDS]->(Award)

Creating Nodes and Relationships:
// Create Movies
CREATE (m1:Movie {title: 'Movie1', business: 1000000})
CREATE (m2:Movie {title: 'Movie2', business: 1500000})

// Create Actors
CREATE (a1:Actor {name: 'Actor1'})
CREATE (a2:Actor {name: 'Actor2'})
CREATE (a3:Actor {name: 'Actor3'})

// Create Relationships (ACTED_IN)
CREATE (m1)-[:ACTED_IN]->(a1)
CREATE (m1)-[:ACTED_IN]->(a2)
CREATE (m2)-[:ACTED_IN]->(a1)
CREATE (m2)-[:ACTED_IN]->(a3)

// Create Awards
CREATE (award1:Award {name: 'Best Actor'})
CREATE (award2:Award {name: 'Best Movie'})

// Create Relationships (HAS_AWARDS)
CREATE (m1)-[:HAS_AWARDS]->(award1)
CREATE (m2)-[:HAS_AWARDS]->(award2)

Queries:
a. Find the movie which made the highest business:
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m.title, m.business
ORDER BY m.business DESC
LIMIT 1;

b. Display details of a movie along with actors:
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Movie1'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(a:Actor)
RETURN m.title, a.name;

c. List all the movies of "Shahrukh Khan" (assuming Shahrukh Khan is an actor in the database):
MATCH (a:Actor {name: 'Shahrukh Khan'})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title;

d. Display all movies having more than 2 awards received:
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:HAS_AWARDS]->(award)
WITH m, COUNT(award) AS numAwards
WHERE numAwards > 2
RETURN m.title, numAwards;
