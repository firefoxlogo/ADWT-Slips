Solution
Collection: Competitions
●	Attributes:
○	CompetitionID (unique identifier)
○	CompetitionName
○	Participants (array of participant details)
{ "CompetitionID": 1, "CompetitionName": "Coding Challenge", "Participants": [
  {"StudentID": 101, "StudentName": "John Doe", "Class": "FY", "Position": 2},
  {"StudentID": 102, "StudentName": "Jane Smith", "Class": "SY", "Position": 1},
  {"StudentID": 103, "StudentName": "Mike Johnson", "Class": "TY", "Position": 3},
  // ... (more participants)
] }

{ "CompetitionID": 2, "CompetitionName": "E-Rangoli", "Participants": [
  {"StudentID": 104, "StudentName": "Emily Brown", "Class": "FY", "Position": 1},
  {"StudentID": 105, "StudentName": "Alex White", "Class": "SY", "Position": 2},
  {"StudentID": 106, "StudentName": "Katie Khan", "Class": "TY", "Position": 3},
  // ... (more participants)
] }

// ... (more competition documents)

Queries:
a. Display average no. of students participating in each competition:
db.Competitions.aggregate([
  {
	$project: {
  	_id: 0,
  	CompetitionName: 1,
  	AverageParticipants: { $avg: { $size: "$Participants" } }
	}
  }
])

b. Find the number of students for programming competition:
db.Competitions.find({ "CompetitionName": "Coding Challenge" }, { _id: 0, Participants: 1 })

c. Display the names of the first three winners of each competition:
db.Competitions.aggregate([
  {
	$project: {
  	_id: 0,
  	CompetitionName: 1,
  	Winners: { $slice: ["$Participants", 3] }
	}
  }
])

d. Display students from class 'FY' and participated in 'E-Rangoli' Competition:
db.Competitions.find(
  {
	"CompetitionName": "E-Rangoli",
	"Participants.Class": "FY"
  },
  { _id: 0, Participants: { $elemMatch: { Class: "FY" } } }
)
